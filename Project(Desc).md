## Core Features 

1. Resume Analyzer & Optimization  
   - Purpose: Improve resumes to pass ATS and better match job descriptions.  
   - Modes:
     - ATS Score Check Mode: User uploads resume → system analyzes format, keywords, structure → generates ATS score + suggestions.
     - Job Description-Based Optimization: User uploads resume + job description → system compares both → suggests targeted edits to increase match.
   - Key outputs: ATS score, actionable suggestions, optimized resume versions.  
   - Outcome: Higher ATS score, resume aligned to job requirements, lower rejection rate.

2. Career Roadmap & Course Recommendation  
   - Purpose: Give learners a clear, ordered plan to reach a career goal.  
   - How it works: User enters career goal (e.g., Java Developer) → AI generates step-by-step roadmap, skills progression (beginner → advanced), and curated learning resources (YouTube, courses, PDFs, books).  
   - Outcome: Structured learning path and prioritized resources to avoid aimless preparation.

3. Personality Development & Communication Skills  
   - Purpose: Build soft skills often overlooked by students (confidence, body language, mindset, communication).  
   - Components:
     - Personality Development: Eight progressive levels, each with activities and practice tasks to build confidence and professional presence.
     - Communication Practice: AI provides a topic; user records up to 2 minutes of speech → AI analyzes clarity, confidence, vocabulary, and gives feedback.  
   - Outcome: Improved confidence, speaking ability, and workplace/interview readiness.

4. AI-Powered Mock Interviews  
   - Purpose: Simulate real interview experience and provide actionable feedback.  
   - How it works: User selects domain/topic → AI asks five interview questions → user records responses → AI evaluates answers (strengths, weaknesses) and offers improvement suggestions.  
   - Outcome: Practical interview practice without needing a human interviewer; targeted improvements.

5. SkillTracker (User Progress System)  
   - Purpose: Track user activity, progress, and engagement across the platform.
